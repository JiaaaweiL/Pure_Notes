```systemverilog
covergroup cg with function sample(
  bit [63:0] a,
  bit [63:0] b,
  bit [3:0]  op,
  bit [5:0]  b_shift_bits
);
  // This generates a bunch of ranges across possible values of a,
  // and ensures at least one value in each range is covered.
  coverpoint a;

  // Same for b.
  coverpoint b;

  // Checks that your testbench exercises all valid operations.
  coverpoint op {
    bins range[] = {[0:8]};
  }

  // This is called a "cross cover" -- it checks that for both
  // left and right shifts, you test all possible values of b
  // (there are only 64 possibilities for the shift value).

  all_shifts: cross b_shift_bits, op {
    ignore_bins other_ops = binsof(op) intersect {[0:5]};
    ignore_bins popcnt_invalid = binsof(op) intersect {[8:15]};
  }

  // More complicated coverage could be written, but we'll leave
  // that for part 3.

endgroup : cg
